There are two active versions of HeaterMeter, v4.2 (aka 4.2.4) and v4.3 (aka 4.3.2). Both are equivalent in terms of functionality, their only difference is the form factor of the finished device. The largest difference is that v4.2 supports old (original) Raspberry Pi Model B and the v4.3 supports more modern Raspberry Pi.
