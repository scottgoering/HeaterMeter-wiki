(Still working on this page)

As a reminder, HeaterMeter refers to the ATmega (Arduino) based microcontroller board that runs the LCD, reads button and temperature probe inputs, and controls the blower motor. This document describes the configurations and design of the HeaterMeter board, which may optionally be installed into an OpenWrt-compatible router to become a LinkMeter.

Official hardware is still being determined pending sample circuit boards coming back from the PCB manufacturer (design sent 2011-08-29). The approximate design can be found in the git /eagle/ directory, however this is **not** the final design and is definitely changed since the last check-in. Once hardware is proven working, the EAGLE schematic and board will be made available as well as parts lists for various configurations.

This hopefully will be completed in September 2011.
