### La Crosse Transmitters
The HeaterMeter RF protocol was chosen to be compatible with La Crosse IT+915Mhz weather station transmitters. However, not all transmitters are supported due to their slightly different protocols. I do not have access to different transmitters to be able to reverse engineer their protocols. Known working transmitters:

* TX28U-IT
* TX29UDTH-IT
